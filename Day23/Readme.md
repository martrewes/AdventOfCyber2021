# `[Blue Teaming]` PowershELlF Magic

## Story

>One of the administrators with access to the Elf Dome Defense system realized that his password file was missing from his desktop. Without the password, he will not be able to log into the Mission Control panel. McSkidy suspects that perhaps one of the previous phishing attempts was successful. McSkidy jumps into action.
>
>You need to inspect the event logs to determine what has occurred and see if you can retrieve the password from the deleted text file.
