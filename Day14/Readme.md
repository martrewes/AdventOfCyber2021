### What are the five characters following $6$G in pepper's password hash? `*****`

I had to change the loot.sh script to cat out `/etc/shadow`. Then navigated to http://10.10.108.126/admin.

### What is the content of the flag.txt file on the Grinch's userâ€™s desktop? `***************************`

First I changed the `loot.sh` script to display `check.sh` on the admin page. Looking at this, I was able to deduce that I need to create a file called `remindme.txt` in the loot folder. This will allow me to see the password using http://10.10.108.126/pass.

This same process can be used to display the contents of `flag.txt`
