# `[Blue Teaming]` How It Happened

## Story
> McSkidy has finally gotten around to identifying the first trace of Grinch Enterprises within their network. They're looking at local machines to determine what exactly they did when they first entered the network. Can you help them make sense of what happened?

### What is the username (email address of Grinch Enterprises) from the decoded script? `******.***********.**********.***`

I pulled the `.doc` from their server to work on it locally.

```shell
$ python oledump.py Santa_Claus_Naughty_List_2021.doc -s 8 -d
$H

```

I pulled this [string](oleDumpBase64.txt) from the dump and used cyberchef to first decode it from base64, then xor it with the value of 35 (decimal). This then gave another base64 [string](secondStageBase64.txt) which I decoded again to get the [script](decodedScript.txt).
